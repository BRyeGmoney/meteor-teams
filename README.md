[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BRyeGmoney/meteor-teams.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BRyeGmoney/meteor-teams)

This package is definitely based on the same ideas as alanning:roles but with teams "groups" taking center stage. This allows me to use mongo's materialized paths pattern to allow for a hierarchy between teams.

0.0.2 Supports:
-Adding and deleting teams
-Adding hierarchy to teams
-All team names must be unique
-Checking if a user is in a team
-Checking if a user belongs to a team down stream
